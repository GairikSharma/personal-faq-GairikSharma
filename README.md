This is a personal FAQ web application for a developer that is me.
There are several static questions with answers displayed over the app.
This is a static app built with React.

Open the app with https://livetocode-personal-faq.netlify.app/

Hoping to add a form later on, integrating it with node to interact with the visitor
if they are interested to ask any more questions.

[Note : For now this is only for practicing my React Skills]
